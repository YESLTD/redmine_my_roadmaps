= my_roadmaps

This plugin provides global roadmaps for all the projects of the user.

All your comments are greatly welcome: this is my first attempt at Ruby, Rails and Redmine plugin, so it most probably won't qualify as "state of the art".

Please note that the main development branch (master) is for the Redmine 1.x. The Redmine_2.0 branch track Redmine 2.0.x compatibility, Redmine_2.1 branch is suitable for both Redmine 2.1 and 2.2 versions and Redmine_2.3 for 2.3 versions.

As usual, each version is available on Redmine plugin catalog in both flavors (Redmine 1 and Redmine 2): http://www.redmine.org/plugins/my_roadmaps
